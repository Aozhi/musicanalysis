# Music Analysis

[Try it now!](https://hlorenzi.github.io/musicanalysis/)

This is a tool for composing or analyzing music.

It's currently a proof-of-concept, and, as such, it is
very unoptimized performance-wise.

Most editing tools are currently keyboard-only.
Play around with the Ctrl, Alt, and Shift key modifiers.

In the future, it should support:

- [ ] Full roman numeral harmony analysis
- [ ] Save/Load from Dropbox, URL, or local files
- [ ] Import/Export from MIDI, tracker, and other formats
- [ ] Song parameter changes, such as tempo
- [ ] Note pitch bending
- [ ] Multiple tracks and instruments
- [ ] Note/Track parameter changes, such as note velocity
